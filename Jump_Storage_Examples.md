# Different Jump Storage examples

All the methods described in this section assume that Ori is standing still on solid ground with no
buttons pressed unless otherwise stated.

## Running off a ledge
The most straightforward way to store a jump! You only need to:
1. Hold down the **Glide** button.
2. Hold down **Right** or **Left** to have Ori walk off a ledge.
3. At any point, release **Glide** and immediately press **Jump**.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between
steps 2 and 3.

## Standing Glide Jump
1. Hold down the **Glide** button.
2. **Jump**. Pressing the button for longer will make Ori jump higher.
3. At any point after Ori starts gliding down, release **Glide** and immediately press **Jump** again.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between
steps 2 and 3.

## Running Glide Jump
A bit more tricky than Standing Glide Jumps. The problem with moving sideways is that it interferes
with the jump logic, so you need to start gliding *after* leaving the ground.
1. Hold down **Right** or **Left** to get Ori moving.
2. **Jump** and, within the coyote frames, hold down the **Glide** button. Pressing the jump button for longer will make Ori jump higher.
3. At any point after Ori starts gliding down, release **Glide** and immediately press **Jump** again.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between
steps 2 and 3.

## Using Spear

1. Throw out a Spear.
2. Press **Jump** right as Ori finishes turn-around animation.

You can optionally hold Glide during the spear animation to move around once it has finished. If you
choose to do so, you can glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls
before jumping.

## Using Bash
Keep in mind this won't work if Ori goes into the Bash position too high off the ground. 
1. Hold down the **Glide** button.
2. **Bash** an enemy.
3. At any point after Ori starts gliding down, release **Glide** and immediately press **Jump**.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between steps 2 and 3.

## Using WaterDash to set up storage in water
This is redundant with just gliding down to water with jump storage, but extremely powerful to exit water with
a lot of height.
1. While being **grounded** close to water, use **WaterDash** to enter the water. Alternatively, **Glide** down into water with jump storage ready.
2. You can freely move around in water for as long as you'd like. You can also tread the surface.
3. When you want to use your stored jump, hold down **Glide**.
4. Use **WaterDash** to exit the water.
5. At any point after Ori starts gliding down, release **Glide** and immediately press **Jump**.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between steps 4 and 5.

## Using Burrow to set up storage in sand
This works when burrowing from any side, not just from above. Just make sure you're standing on solid ground.

1. While being **grounded** close to sand, use **Burrow** to enter the sand.
2. You can freely move around in sand for as long as you'd like.
3. When you want to use your stored jump, hold down **Glide**.
4. Use **Burrow** to exit the sand.
5. At any point after Ori starts gliding down, release **Glide** and immediately press **Jump**.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between steps 4 and 5.
