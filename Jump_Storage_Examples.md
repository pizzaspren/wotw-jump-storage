# Different Jump Storage examples

All the methods described in this section assume that Ori is standing still on solid ground with no
buttons pressed unless otherwise stated.

## Standing Glide Jump
The most straightforward way to store a jump! You only need to:
1. Hold down the **Glide** button.
2. Hold down the **Jump** button.
3. Once Ori has reached the peak of the jump, release the **Jump** button.
4. At any point after reaching the peak of the jump, release **Glide** and immediately press **Jump** again.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between steps 2 and 4.

## Running Glide Jump
A bit more tricky than Standing Glide Jumps.
1. Hold down **Right** or **Left** to get Ori moving.
2. Hold down the **Jump** button and, immediately after, hold down the **Glide** button.
3. Once Ori has reached the peak of the jump, release the **Jump** button. 
4. At any point after reaching the peak of the jump, release **Glide** and immediately press **Jump** again.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between steps 2 and 4.

## Running off a ledge
Same as Standing Glide Jumps but without actually jumping? I don't know, I don't make the rules here.
1. Hold down the **Glide** button.
2. Hold down **Right** or **Left** to have Ori walk off a ledge.
3. At any point, release **Glide** and immediately press **Jump**.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between steps 2 and 3.

## Using Spear
For when you're too lazy to jump and have energy to spare.
1. Throw out a Spear.
2. (Optionally) Hold down **Glide** at any point before the spear animation finishes. If you choose to do this, you can then glide around to other places.
3. (If pressed, release **Glide** and immediately...) Press **Jump** right as Ori finishes turning around.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between steps 2 and 4.

## Using Bash
Keep in mind this won't work if Ori goes into the Bash position too high off the ground. 
1. Hold down the **Glide** button.
2. **Bash** an enemy.
3. At any point after reaching the peak of the bash trajectory, release **Glide** and immediately press **Jump** again.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between steps 2 and 3.

## Using WaterDash to set up storage in water
This is redundant with just gliding down to water with jump storage, but extremely powerful to exit water with
a lot of height.
1. While being **grounded** close to water, use **WaterDash** to enter the water. Alternatively, **Glide** down into water with jump storage ready.
2. You can freely move around in water for as long as you'd like. You can also tread the surface.
3. When you want to use your stored jump, hold down **Glide**.
4. Use **WaterDash** to exit the water.
5. At any point after reaching the peak of the trajectory, release **Glide** and immediately press **Jump** again.

You are free to glide around as much as you'd like without touching the ground or any walls between steps 4 and 5.
